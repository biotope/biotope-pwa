# Localhost / Development - Environment

## Testing
You can run the service worker on your local server, as chrome allows to install service workers on `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` without https. As soon as you put it online, you need https for it to work.
  
## Push Notifications
To test the push event just click the push trigger in the chrome applications => service workers tab.
